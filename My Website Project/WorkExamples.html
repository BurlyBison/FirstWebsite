        <br>
        <br>

        <p> What you will see here is a few images and descriptions of assignments that I have worked on utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer 
            <br>to create a virtually simulated network environment:</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Overview of a network</h3>

            <br>

            <p>Here we have a couple of overviews of the network environments that I have simulated in Packet Tracer.</p>

            <br>

            <p>The image below pictures a network environment that I set up and configured involving HSRP to make sure that if one router in one location fails that the standby router
                <br> will then become the active router and pick up where the last one left off. It uses OSPF to ensure that fastest possible transmission of data and has default route
                <br> set to ensure that the endpoint devices will have access to internet connectivity. The IP configuration and port connections are all labelled within the image.

            <p>This image below pictures yet another network environment, however, this time outlining a network layout in a theoretical office building.</p>
