  <h2>Company History</h2>

  <br>
  <br>

  <p>Chew Technologies was founded in July of 2022 by Thomas Chew. From there we gathered a small development team and started off
    by doing small network implementations and helping monitor network traffic as well as security to any organization that was willing
    to outsource to us. From there we slowly built up our stock of I.T. Related products and worked on strengthening out connections with
    employers. Now we are the comapny that you know today as an international information technology powerhouse.
